# Task-2: GPIO and UART Validation

## Objective
The objective of Task-2 is to verify GPIO and UART functionality on the VSDSquadron Mini board.

---

## What I did
- Powered the VSDSquadron Mini board
- Wrote firmware to blink the onboard LED
- Implemented delay using Delay_Ms()
- Added UART print statements using printf()

---

## GPIO Result
- GPIO pin PD6 was configured as output
- LED connected to PD6 blinks every 1 second
- This confirms GPIO and delay functionality

---

## UART Implementation
- UART messages were added in firmware using printf()
- Messages such as LED ON and LED OFF are printed in code

---

## UART Monitoring Limitation
- The USB cable used supports power and programming only
- The board USB interface (WCH-Link) is not mapped to UART
- Therefore, UART output could not be viewed in Serial Monitor

---

## Conclusion
- GPIO LED blinking is successfully verified on hardware
- UART functionality is implemented at code level
- Task-2 is completed with documented hardware limitation
